            <p><span>Tundra</span> (/tʌndrə, tʊn-/) is a type of biome where tree growth is hindered by frigid temperatures and short growing seasons. The term tundra comes through Russian тундра (tundra) from the Kildin Sámi word тӯндар (tūndâr) meaning "uplands", "treeless mountain tract". There are three regions and associated types of tundra: Arctic tundra, alpine tundra, and Antarctic tundra.</p>
            <img id="globalLevel" alt="globalTundraZone" src="./assets/img/globalTundra.jpg">
            <p>
                <span>Tundra</span> vegetation is composed of dwarf shrubs, sedges, grasses, mosses, and lichens. Scattered trees grow in some tundra regions. The ecotone (or ecological boundary region) between the tundra and the forest is known as the tree line or timberline. The tundra soil is rich in nitrogen and phosphorus.
            </p>
            <p>The <span>tundra’s</span> growing season is very short as the region’s temperatures are only above freezing for a few months. This means that most tundra plants are perennials: plants that sit dormant during the winter before returning every summer. Tundra plants must grow very quickly in order to take advantage of the brief summer. A distinct feature of the region’s flora is its inability to grow long roots. Tundra plants cannot develop extensive root systems, as they only have a short layer of soil before they hit the impenetrable permafrost.  Without long roots, plants rely on the annual melting to obtain enough water. In the summer, the uppermost layer of frozen topsoil begins to thaw, causing bogs to form at the surface from which the plants’ short roots are able to collect water. Along with their lack of deep root systems, tundra plants possess more adaptations that allow for their survival. Growing close to one another allows the plants to protect themselves from the extreme temperatures, and remaining short and low to the ground protects them from heavy winds. Although life in the tundra may be difficult, many different plant species are well enough adapted to survive there. Tundra ecosystems contain an estimated 1,700 different types of plants, including shrubs, mosses, lichens, sedges, and many others. Notably missing from the lineup are trees – not one tree species is native to tundras. In fact, the name tundra actually comes from the Finnish word “tunturia” meaning treeless. The biome’s permafrost does not allow for the level of root growth needed to support trees. The low levels of rainfall and heavy winds further prohibit trees from growing there.</p>

Sea mammals and sea birds, including seals and penguins, inhabit areas near the shore, and some small mammals, like rabbits and cats, have been introduced by humans to some of the subantarctic islands

                    The animal species found in the Tundra feature herbivores and carnivores. Some herbivores that reside there are the arctic hare, caribou, arctic ground squirrel, lemmings, and voles. Some carnivores found there are polar bears, arctic foxes, and wolves. There is a wide range of bird species in this ecosystem, as there are ravens, snow buntings, falcons, loons, sandpipers, terns, gulls, Snowy Owls, and the semipalmated plover. Another animal found in the Tundra is the Musk Ox. Fish that are found there are cod, Flatfish, salmon, and trout. Though the tundra is very cold, it still has insects. For example, there are mosquitoes, flies, moths, black flies, and grasshoppers. The Tundra has relatively low biodiversity because of the lack of food and the cold. These animals must nurture their young quickly during the summer months. Most of the animals found there have white fur as they have adapted to camouflage with the snow and ice around them.
